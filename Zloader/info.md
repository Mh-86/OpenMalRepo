ZLoader, a variant of the infamous Zeus banking malware, has been around since 2006. It is a typical banking malware that makes use of webinjects to steal credentials and other private information from users of targeted financial institutions. The malware can also steal passwords and cookies stored in victim’s web browsers. With the stolen information in hand, the malware can use the VNC (Virtual Network Computing) client it downloads to allow threat actors to connect to the victim’s system and make illicit financial transactions from the banking user’s legitimate device.
